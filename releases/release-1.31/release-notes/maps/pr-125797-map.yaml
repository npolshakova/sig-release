  text: 'kubeadm: the `--feature-gates` flag is deprecated and no-op for `kubeadm
    upgrade apply/plan`, and it will be removed in a future release. The upgrade workflow
    is not designed to reconfigure the cluster. Please edit the ''featureGates'' field
    of ClusterConfiguration which is defined in the kube-system/kubeadm-config ConfigMap
    instead.'
