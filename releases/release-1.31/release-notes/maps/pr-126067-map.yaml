    Graduated the Job `successPolicy` field to beta.

    The new reason label, "SuccessPolicy" and "CompletionsReached" are added to the "jobs_finished_total" metric.
    Additionally, if you enable the `JobSuccessPolicy` feature gate, the Job gets "CompletionsReached" reason for the "SuccessCriteriaMet" and "Complete" condition type
    when the number of succeeded Job Pods (`.status.succeeded`) reached the desired completions (`.spec.completions`).
