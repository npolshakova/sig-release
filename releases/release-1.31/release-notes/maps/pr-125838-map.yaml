  text: The Service trafficDistribution field has graduated to beta and is now available
    for configuration by default, without the need to enable any feature flag. Services
    that do not have the field configured will continue to operate with their existing
    behavior. Refer to the documentation https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#traffic-distribution
    for more details.
