  text: Enforced kubelet to request serving certificates only once it has at least
    one IP address in the `.status.addresses` of its associated Node object. This
    avoids requesting DNS-only serving certificates before externally set addresses
    are in place. Until 1.33, the previous behavior can be opted back into by setting
    the deprecated `AllowDNSOnlyNodeCSR` feature gate to true in the kubelet.
