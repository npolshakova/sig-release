    kubeadm: deprecated the kubeadm `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate (previously alpha), given that the core K8s `UserNamespacesSupport` feature gate graduated to beta in 1.30.
    Once core Kubernetes support for user namespaces is generally available and kubeadm has started to support running the control plane in userns pods, the kubeadm `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate will be removed entirely.
    Until kubeadm supports the userns functionality out of the box, users can continue using the deprecated  `RootlessControlPlane` feature gate, or  opt-in `UserNamespacesSupport` by using kubeadm patches on the static pod manifests.
