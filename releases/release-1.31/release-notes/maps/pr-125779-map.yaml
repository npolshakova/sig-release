  text: 'kubeadm: fixed a bug where the path of the manifest can not be specified when
    `kubeadm upgrade diff` specified a config file, and the `--api-server-manifest`,
    `--controller-manager-manifest` and `--scheduler-manifest` flags of `kubeadm upgrade
    diff` are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release.'
