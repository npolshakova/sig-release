  text: 'KEP-1880: Users of the new feature to add multiple service CIDR will use
    by default a dual-write strategy on the new ClusterIP allocators to avoid the
    problem of possible duplicate IPs allocated to Services when running skewed kube-apiservers
    using different allocators. They can opt-out of this behavior by enabled the feature
