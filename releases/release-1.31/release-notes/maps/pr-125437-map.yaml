   "Removed the ability to run `kubectl exec [POD] [COMMAND]` without a `--` separator.
   The `--` separator has been recommended since the Kubernetes v1.18 release, which also deprecated the legacy way of invoking `kubectl exec`.

   This change aligns with the deprecation of legacy `kubectl exec` command execution and enforces the use of `kubectl exec [POD] -- [COMMAND]` for improved compatibility and adherence to recommended practices."
