    the FailureTarget condition is also added to the Job object in the first Job\nstatus
    update as soon as the failure conditions are met (backoffLimit is exceeded, maxFailedIndexes,
    \nor activeDeadlineSeconds is exceeded).\n\nSimilarly, the SuccessCriteriaMet
    condition is added in the first update as soon as the expected number\nof pod
    completions is reached.\n\nAlso, introduce the following validation rules for
    Job status when JobManagedBy is enabled:\n1. the count of ready pods is less or
    equal than active\n2. when transitioning to terminal phase for Job, the number
    of terminating pods is 0\n3. terminal Job conditions (Failed and Complete) should
    be preceded by adding the corresponding interim conditions: FailureTarget and
    SuccessCriteriaMet"
