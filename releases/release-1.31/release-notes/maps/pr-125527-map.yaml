  text: "Fixed a bug that Pods could stuck in the unschedulable pod pool \nif they're
    rejected by PreEnqueue plugins that could change its result by a change in resources
    apart from Pods.\n\nDRA plugin is the only plugin that meets the criteria of the
    bug in in-tree, \nand hence if you have `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature flag
    enabled, \nyour DRA Pods could be affected by this bug."
