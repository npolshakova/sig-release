pr: 126441
releasenote:
  text: Ensured that the Node Admission plugin to reject CSR requests created by a
    node identity for the signers `kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving` or `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet`
    with a CN starting with `system:node:`, but where the CN is not `system:node:${node-name}`.
    The feature gate `AllowInsecureKubeletCertificateSigningRequests` defaults to
    `false`, but can be enabled to revert to the previous behavior. This feature gate
    will be removed in Kubernetes v1.33.
