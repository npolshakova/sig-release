  text: The scheduling queue didn't notice any extenders' failures, it could miss
    some cluster events, and it could end up Pods rejected by Extenders stuck in unschedulable
    pod pool in 5min in the worst-case scenario. Now, the scheduling queue notices
    extenders' failures and requeue Pods rejected by Extenders appropriately.
